            <h2>About "Гей, соколи!"</h2>
            <p>"Гей, соколи!" is traditionally considered a Ukrainian folk song, believed to be written by Tomasz Padura, though this attribution remains debated among scholars(Olha Kharchyshyn, 2019). The song is about a young Cossack saying farewell to his beloved and Ukraine, symbolizing themes of love, separation, and longing for the homeland. It has become an enduring cultural symbol, especially during times of conflict, like the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, where it was used to boost morale and express solidarity.</p>

            <h2>Historical and Social Background</h2>
            <h3>Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Occupation of Ukraine</h3>
            <p>Before the Union of Lublin in 1569, the territories of modern-day Ukraine were largely under the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the signing of the Union of Lublin, Poland and Lithuania merged to form the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a political and military alliance designed to counter threats from neighboring states like Muscovy and the Ottoman Empire. This agreement transferred significant Ukrainian regions—including Volhynia, Podolia, and the Kiev Voivodeship—from Lithuanian to direct Polish control (Helbig, Buranbaeva, & Mladineo, 2009, p. 27).</p>
            <p>The new political structure allowed Polish nobles (szlachta) to acquire vast Ukrainian estates, which they governed with near-absolute authority. They implemented a strict feudal system in which Ukrainian peasants were subjected to serfdom. This meant peasants were bound to the land and forced to provide labor or pay taxes to the Polish landlords. Economic exploitation was rampant, as Ukrainian peasants often faced increased obligations, heavier taxation, and fewer rights compared to Polish peasants. The loss of freedoms led to significant economic hardship and a deep resentment of Polish rule.</p>
            <h3>Cossacks(Козаки) and Freedom</h3>
            <p>The Cossacks emerged in the 15th and 16th centuries as free warrior groups in the frontier regions of what is now Ukraine, especially in the Dnieper River Basin. Initially, they were formed by runaway peasants, serfs, adventurers, and outlaws fleeing feudal oppression in Polish, Lithuanian, and Russian territories, seeking freedom in the vast steppe lands. The sparsely populated borderlands, beyond the control of centralized authorities, provided a suitable environment for these groups to establish independent communities (Helbig, Buranbaeva, & Mladineo, 2009, p. 54).</p>
            <p>However, after the Union of Lublin in 1569, which transferred Ukrainian territories from Lithuanian to Polish control, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth began imposing stricter control over these regions. This imposition of authority clashed with the Cossacks' inherent love of freedom, a core aspect of Ukrainian identity, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among many Cossacks.</p>
            <h3>Reasons for Ukrainian Resistance</h3>
            <p>The resistance against Polish control stemmed from grievances such as social and economic oppression, religious discrimination, and political marginalization. Ukrainians, especially the Cossacks, felt disenfranchised and desired greater autonomy and the right to self-govern.</p>

            <h3>Detailed Account of the Uprisings</h3>
            <h4>Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1657)</h4>
            <p>Bohdan Khmelnytsky, a Cossack leader, ignited a widespread rebellion against Polish rule in 1648. The uprising involved alliances with Tatars and Muscovites, significant battles, and political maneuvering, leading to massive social upheaval in Ukraine.</p>

            <h4>Subsequent Uprisings and Continued Resistance</h4>
            <p>Following the Khmelnytsky Uprising, other rebellions like the Pavlyuk and Ostrianytsia Uprisings (1637-1638) and the Koliivshchyna Rebellion (1768) continued the struggle against Polish control.</p>

            <h3>Long-Term Consequences</h3>
            <p>The continuous uprisings weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, leading to partitions and the transfer of Ukrainian lands. These struggles contributed to a distinct Ukrainian identity marked by resistance against external control.</p>
            
            <h2>Creation and Popularity</h2>

            <h3>The Origins of "Гей, соколи!"</h3>
            <p>
            Although the exact time and author of "Гей, соколи!" remain uncertain, the song's themes and style are deeply rooted in Ukrainian history and culture. Scholars suggest that its lyrics reflect the blending of Cossack traditions and folk motifs, possibly integrating themes from 19th-century Polish songs, such as "Żal za Ukrainą" (Olha Kharchyshyn, 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
            The song likely originated during the Cossack era (16th to 18th centuries), when folk songs served as essential cultural expressions, capturing collective emotions and social changes. It was transmitted orally by Cossack communities and became a staple of village celebrations (Olha Kharchyshyn, 2019).
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Spread of "Гей, соколи!" Across Borders</h3>
            <p>
            By the 19th century, "Гей, соколи!" gained popularity beyond Ukraine, particularly in Poland, reflecting the shared cultural heritage of these regions. Its poignant lyrics and memorable melody made it a beloved folk classic. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Markets and Celebrations:</strong> Ukrainian village markets and festivals often became venues for performing such songs. These events provided platforms for cultural preservation and oral traditions (Olha Kharchyshyn, 2019).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Theater and Literary Works:</strong> During the Ukrainian national revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, songs like "Гей, соколи!" were incorporated into plays and literature to bolster national identity and cultural pride (Balandina, 2019).
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>20th-Century Revival and International Spread</h3>
            <p>
            Throughout the 20th century, "Гей, соколи!" was revived as a cultural anthem. It became a rallying cry during wartime, sung by soldiers to boost morale and express longing for their homeland (Olha Kharchyshyn, 2019). 
            Ukrainian immigrants spread the song to new countries, making it a cultural link among diaspora communities (Olha Kharchyshyn, 2019).</p>
            <h3>"Гей, соколи!" in the Film "With Fire and Sword"</h3>
            <p>
            The song "Гей, соколи!" gained renewed popularity when it was featured prominently in the Polish historical film <em>Ogniem i Mieczem</em> ("With Fire and Sword"), released in 1999. Directed by Jerzy Hoffman, the movie is an adaptation of the novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, which depicts the events of the Khmelnytsky Uprising in the mid-17th century. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The inclusion of "Гей, соколи!" in a key scene reflects the deep cultural ties between Poland and Ukraine, as well as the song’s enduring themes of love, separation, and the longing for home. The scene where the song is performed captures the emotional essence of the narrative, resonating with both historical and modern audiences.

            <h2>Modern Relevance</h2>
            <p>During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, "Hej, Sokoły!" was revived as a song of resistance and solidarity. It served as an anthem of unity, bridging historical and contemporary struggles for freedom, as seen in a montage video on YouTube by Ukrainian forces using the song to boost morale and encourage the defense of their homeland.</p>
            <p>On this land between the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains, generation after generation of young people have gone to the battlefield for freedom and for their loved ones. Their resilience and bravery have nurtured confident and healthy sunflowers under the blue sky, allowing the sun to rise again and again over this land.</p>
